### Summary

Paradise Soccer Club connects the beautiful game of soccer with the lifestyle of Hawai’i. I worked with PSC to build a website and e-commerce store to connect their brand to their fans across the world. 

### Kick-off

Max and I grew up in the same town in Hawaii but I didn’t get to know him until I moved away to San Francisco (funny how that happens). He played soccer with my best friend and that’s how we met. Hawaii does not have any professional sports teams, so many of its youth turn to the beautiful game as their favorite pastime. Max saw an opportunity to blend the culture of Hawaii with the sport of futbol, Paradise Soccer Club was born.

It all started with his Instagram account which currently has 7,000+ followers but Max had bigger dreams. He opened his storefront in Kailua, Oahu on June 21, 2013 to open arms from the community. His social media presence and collaborations with Hawaii’s premier lifestyle brands exploded his reach. 

More importantly PSC isn’t just about selling merchandise, it’s about giving back to the community. He hosts soccer tournaments with cash prizes, he holds FIFA tournaments and gives away merchandise to its winners. His store and brand has been and will always be an ohana for those who love the beautiful game.

## The Problem
*The lay of the land, why I was brought in*
<!-- I was hired to create a website to tell the PSC story and connect those visitors to his products. In the process we developed a fully functioning marketing and commerce site. -->

#### Passing the ball
I started talking with Max in June 2013, we kicked a few emails back and forth and identified a lot of areas where I could help. He wanted to provide his Instagram followers with more information about his shop. He was also in talks to begin producing his own merchandise. He needed a website to help facilitate these two goals.

*Place email correspondence here*

It’s important to note that PSC is run and operated by Max alone. He doesn’t have content generators, inventory managers, marketing analysts, he didn’t even have a website. I was happy to help out a friend and excited to help push this brand forward. 

I started by asking a few questions:

#### What do you want the site to achieve?
He wanted to communicate his brand and his product offerings to his fans. He also wanted a place to sell his products. 

#### Who is your target audience?
He identified that his core audience would be teens to twenty-somethings passionate about soccer. He also identified families as children getting interested in soccer could grow into customers.

#### Will you need to update it?
He didn't have a need to update the sites code but wanted to actively post a blog portion about sales and events.

#### What is the current site setup?
At this point, PSC's only digital presence was their Instagram account, which was very popular (8,000+ followers). A lot of traffic would be driven from his social media so it was important to really nail the mobile experience. He was using Godaddy to park his domain with no hosting. Here is the initial sitemap:

- Homepage
- About Us
- Contact Us
- Events
- Blog
- Shop

This was defintely enough to get started. 


## Playing the game
*Starting on the site*

#### Phases
We started talking a couple days before the opening of his physical storefront and while I would have loved to release a fully functioning site by then, it wasn't going to happen. There was still a lot to talk about and a lot of direction to be hashed out. We decided to roll the site out in phases. 

#### Phase One: The Great Image
The first phase was to announce the grand opening of the storefront. Max wanted something: "Simple, clean, with logo front and center or a pic." We had a tight turn around so I turned to Tumblr to quickly execute against the first phase.

I even created a rotating slideshow that changed out the background image, this was out of scope but made the basic site a little more engaging.

#### Phase Two: Fake it till you make it

Phase two was the first attempt to fulfill his need to update the blog, but not the rest of the site. He was very active on Instagram and I knew this would be the easiest way for him to post, I linked his account to tumblr so that everytime he posted to Instagram he had the option to post to his blog. This worked out pretty well and is still how the blog portion operates today. This second phase was also where I laid the ground work of the sites architecture. We were still using Tumblr for hosting and since we were not building a full fledged theme we were limited to its basic html/css capabilities... even external css was a struggle 😔 (more on that later). But it was enough to rough out some early ideas of the site.

#### Phase Three: Goooool
The last and final phase was a full site with a complete e-commerce store.

We started by narrowing down the site map:

- Home
- About
- Shop
- Contact 

It was time to graduate the site, taking it off tumblr and on to its own hosting, using SASS to build repeatable patterns, developing the story, and most importantly creating an e-commerce store.


#### Square Corners The Market
When building the store I was looking into various options: Stripe, Shopify, and Snipcart. [chart of differences?] And while each had their merits, I discovered that he was already using Square in his physical store to sell his products and manage inventory. It made a lot of sense to tie into this system to keep everything in one place. Square makes it super easy to spin up an online store. One key feature is the ability generate product embed codes that can be placed anywhere on the internet.  

#### Patterns
I went back to the wireframe stage and started to block out patterns I would be using:

- Hero Image
- Product Grid
- Image Grid
- Video Block
- Type Treatment

For the About Us page, we wanted to include a section about the events PSC hosted. He had a lot of great video content from these events and I wanted to make this section more immersive than an image of the event. We landed on an auto-looping video shot by <a href="https://vimeo.com/botoboyfilms">Orrin Nakanelua</a>.

#### Finger Tips
We identified his core audience as twenty-somethings using all the social medias. It was important that the site be optimized for mobile finger tips. I began building the patterns with mobile in mind and had a lot of fun exploring the navigation. The navigation element gracefully degrades to meet the various mobile sizes, check it out:

#### News Letters
Instagram was PSC's main marketing channel. I wanted to introduce a secondary channel that would build a list of new customers, cultivate relationships with existing customers, and reach them on all their mobile devices. I'm talking about electronic mail. With the help of Mailchimp we set up a simple input to capture email addresses with the hopes of running full campaigns through email.

#### Launch
We launched the site in accordance with the first anniversary of the storefront opening. This was also during the 2014 Men's World Cup. Max expertly timed a product release to coincide with the new site and the world cup. His <a href="">Merica Jersey</a> was very well received, it helped catapult the site and his brand during the launch and is still the top selling item in his outline store.

<!-- *Reflection: If a reader has stuck around to this point, you can trust them with a bit more vulnerability. Here’s where you share the insights and voices of individual team members — planners, designers, developers, even your client — through brief, focused reflections on the job. What worked? What didn’t? What doubts did you have? What surprised you? What would you have done differently had you more time or more knowledge at the beginning? What did you learn and how will you use that knowledge in the future? This, really, is the most important and substantial piece of the puzzle for a prospect. If they’re seriously evaluating, they’ve probably heard plenty in the problem → solution → outcome department, but your honest and sincere reflection upon it will be what helps them get to know you and want to work with you.* -->

## Yellow Card
*Or things I learned along the way*

#### Not all that squares, is gold
Using Square came with a few drawbacks. One of them being that the actual payment does not actually happen on the paradisesoccerclub.com site. When a user clicks a product they very *subtly* get redirected to the PSC Online shop on Square Market. While this is not terrible, it does introduce another step in the buying process and my focus was to minimize the experience of that step. Another issue arose with the the embedding of products on the store. The embded code used a bit of Javascript which took some time to call the products from Square and in most cases there could be a noticable lag of the items being generated on our site. I am looking into hosting the items on our end for a snappier web experience. 

All in all our decision to leverage square for the online store has been a good one. We're using an existing platform that he is using in the physical store and we can depend on the security of a well-known payments company to handle the online and in-store purchases. Another huge reason for using Square is that it managed product fulfillment all in the same web app. Which is great because Max only needs to go to one place to get information about sales, inventory, and orders. Easy peasy.  

#### Stop trying to make newsletter happen
While building the site I thought it would be great to begin capturing email addresses in hopes of building an active cycle to market existing customers and new customers. Mailchimp was extremely easy to use and integrate and we started collect some email addresses.

*Where we went wrong* We did not accurately scope the time and effort to create, deliver, and nurture amazing campaigns. We sent two emails total which were well received but our list is still too small to make an impact. In the future I'd like to help him streamline this process, possibly generating emails from his Instagram account. 

#### Phases, or nah
I think rolling the site out in phases was a great idea. It helped Max get his feet wet into his brand new website. However it took a while to reach the final site because it introduced some technical debt early on. I needed to get the site out fast so using tumblr was a no-brainer. However, when it was time to build the actual site I was not able to leverage most of the code base (a lot of interal css styles and strange markup). I think if I had asked more pointed questions up front I could have identified his needs quickly and we would have arrived at the brand new site sooner.

<!-- #### First
This was my first experience getting hired to develop a full site. It was very exciting and I learned a lot along the way. I'm looking forward to doing more work like this in the future.  -->
